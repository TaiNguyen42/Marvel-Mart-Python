Title: Project Overview - Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Cross-Reference Statistics

Description: For this project, I focused primarily on handling a large CSV file. My key tasks involved cleaning the data, creating meaningful data visualizations, and performing different types of statistical analyses related to the dataset. To organize the workflow efficiently, the project was segmented into three separate stages:

1. Data Cleaning:
- Tasked with the initial phase of preparing the raw data.
- Focused on cleaning, structuring, and enhancing data quality.
- Addressed inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues.
- Ensured that the dataset was primed for in-depth analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Explored the cleansed data to gain valuable insights.
- Created informative data visualizations to showcase trends, patterns, and outliers.
- Employed descriptive statistics and visualization techniques to uncover hidden relationships within the dataset.
- The EDA phase aimed to provide a solid foundation for subsequent analysis.

3. Cross-Reference Statistics:
- Delved deeper into the dataset, applying advanced statistical methods.
- Conducted cross-referencing analyses to identify correlations and dependencies.
- Generated meaningful metrics and statistical summaries to extract actionable knowledge.
- This phase focused on leveraging the data to draw relevant conclusions and make informed decisions.

By dividing the project into three distinct sections, I established a structured and systematic method for managing the dataset. This approach enhanced my efficiency and facilitated the extraction of valuable insights, which were instrumental in guiding data-driven decision-making throughout the project.
